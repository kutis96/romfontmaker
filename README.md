# RomFontMaker

It's a thing that turns font images into ROMs/LUTs usable in C and other things!

## How do I build it

You will need:
- A JDK for Java 17 (versions ≥ 14 may work; untested)
- Maven
- Some luck

After that, it's the usual `mvn clean package` thing.

You'll find a JAR ending in `-with-dependencies.jar` in the `./target` folder. Run it.

## How do I use it

Just run it, read the "helpful" output.

One Day™ I'll write a proper usage sample here too.

WIP.
